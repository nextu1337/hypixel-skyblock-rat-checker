# hypixel-skyblock-rat-checker
A program that looks for all the URLs in Java files. Mainly used for scanning suspicious SkyBlock mods

# Important information
While this program looks for URLs, it DOES NOT decompile/deobfuscate Java files so even if no URLs are found, there is still a chance the mod is gonna contain a rat 

# Rats
Remote access trojans (RATs) are malware designed to allow an attacker to remotely control an infected computer. Once the RAT is running on a compromised system, the attacker can send commands to it and receive data back in response. 

# Requirements
- Windows
- node.js
- npm

# How to install
To install the program just download all the files and put them in one folder. Then press shift and right click in the folder and click "Open PowerShell window here"<br>
After that type ```npm i``` and wait for npm to download and install all modules.<br>
At the end just open ```start.bat``` and either drag or type in exact .jar file path
