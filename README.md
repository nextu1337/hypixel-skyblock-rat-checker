# jar-ul-checker
A program that looks for all the URLs in Java files. Mainly used for scanning suspicious game modifications that steal your data

# Important information
This program doesn't deobfuscate the jar file itself<br>
Make sure the file is not obfuscated

# Rats
Remote access trojans (RATs) are malware designed to allow an attacker to remotely control an infected computer. Once the RAT is running on a compromised system, the attacker can send commands to it and receive data back in response.

# Requirements
- node.js
- npm

# How to install
To install the program just download all the files and put them in one folder. Then press shift and right click in the folder and click "Open PowerShell window here" (Just right click and click "Open in Terminal" on Linux)<br>
After that type `npm i` and wait for npm to download and install all modules.<br>
At the end just open `start.bat` (sorry linux users) and either drag or type in exact .jar file path

# How I use it
It helped me scan some suspicious Minecraft mods a lot quicker than I would manually but if you plan on checking potential dangerous mods then https://isthisarat.com/ is a better option, I just had to stop procrastinating and code something
